\section{Models of the Atomic Nucleus: Overview}

To unravel the nuclear many-body problem, we can
employ models that incorporate essential details while ignoring specifics with
little relevance to the observables we care about.

Successful models possess both accuracy at reproducing extant experimental data
and predictive power for as-yet unmeasured experimental data (far harder). For parametric models
with many tunable parameters, these criteria pull in oppositive directions: increasing the number
and acceptable range of model parameters often helps to reproduce experimental data but may
jeopardize predictive power if new parameters are not connected to the underlying physics.

Several classes of workhorse models are presented below. Their successes,
failures, and regimes of validity are briefly discussed, with extra attention paid
to each model's confrontation with challenging experimental data.

\subsection{Liquid Drop Model}

The Liquid Drop Model (LDM) describes nuclei as drops of ideal nuclear fluid and
has been successfully employed since the earliest days of nuclear science to
describe nuclear masses and other ground-state properties. The binding of each nucleus are
approximated by five physically-intuitive terms appropriate for a droplet of nuclear matter:

\begin{equation} \label{LDM}
    BE(Z, N) = Vol + Surface + Coulomb + Asymmetry + Spin-Orbit
\end{equation}

a volume term that describes "bulk" binding that would be experienced in an
infinite sea of nuclear matter, or by completely surrounded nucleons in the core of the nucleus,

a surface term that incorporates the finite size of a nucleus (i.e., it is a
drop, not an ocean), equivalent to surface tension,

a coulomb term that incorporates the electric repulsion experienced by protons
constrained in close proximity to each other inside the drop,

an asymmetry term representing the relative chemical potential of neutrons and
protons as a function of their relative population (which can be re-balanced by
beta-decay),

and a spin-orbit term responsible for modeling the interaction of the intrinsic spin
of a nucleus and its constituent nucleons' angular orbital momentum, which is
a much stronger effect in nuclear binding than in the atomic case

The free parameters in each term can be fitted to the hundreds of well-measured nuclear masses
across the chart of nuclides. Surprisingly, these five simple terms are quite successful
in describing masses and radii of spherical nuclei. However, as the quantum
nature of the nuclear many-body problem is completely ignored, the LDM is
unsuitable for extracting wavefunction information or predicting scattering
cross sections.

Extensions to the LDM introduce a series of higher-order terms allowing for coupling
between the five components of \ref{LDM}, each of which that have been expanded about two
fundamental independent quantities, the nucleon density excess $\epsilon$
and neutron density excess $\delta$:

\begin{equation}
    \epsilon = -\frac{1}{3}\frac{(\rho - \rho_{0})}{\rho_{0}}
\end{equation}

\begin{eqation}
    \delta = \frac{\rho_{n}-\rho{z}}{\rho}
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{0}$ is the saturation density, 0.16 nucleons fm$^{-3}$. Relevant quantum
effects, such as changes in level densities near shell closures
that affect the observed masses, can be incorporated through a series of corrections
that approximate shell effects, nucleon-nucleon pairing, and geometric deformation.
One such model, presented in The Droplet Model of Atomic Nuclei
\cite{MyersAndSwiatecki}, deploys 9 
independent coefficients to describe spherical droplets and 6 additional
coefficients to accommodate non-spherical effects. This expanded scope
can successfully recover the degree of ground state deformation in non-spherical
nuclei and fission barriers.

Droplet Model has L=100 and a great match to isotope shift
Isotope shift measured w/ laser spectroscopy by Anselment et al, PRC 34 p 1052,
review article by Otten (see references folder)

By the 1980s, it was clear that the isotope shift in the nuclear RMS
charge radius, shown for the even-A Sn isotopes in Fig.
\ref{SnIsotopeShift} \ref{Anselment1986, Otten1989},
is critically connected to difference in RMS radius 
between the neutron and proton distributions, commonly referred to as the "neutron skin".
In a Droplet Model picture, the slope of the isotope shift is linked to the symmetry energy $J$, 
density dependence of the symmetry energy
$L$, and surface stiffness coefficient $Q$, the same variables that determine
neutron skin thickness \cite{Myers1969, MyersAndSwiatecki, \Berdichevsky1988}.
Without addition experimental constraints, the $J$, $L$, and $Q$ parameters form an
underdetermined system from which unique values cannot be recovered, even if the
consensus value of $J \approx$ 30 MeV is used to reduce the parameter space.
As was already pointed out 50 years ago by Myers \cite{Myers1969},
the single-particle configuration of a given nucleus may have a significant
effect on the formation of the

\end{figure}

\subsection{Mean Field Models}
Mean field models The Independent Particle Model (IPM) provides a complementary approach expressly
focused on the quantum details of the problem. The many-body problem is
approximated by considering each nucleon as moving independently of all other
nucleons in an potential generated by those nucleons. As in the atomic case,
where electrons obey an aufbau principle and populate orbitals defined by the
atomic potential, both protons and neutrons obey a nuclear aufbau, filling
orthogonal states in the nuclear potential. In this model, many fundamental
quantum properties of nuclei are easily understood, (for example, ground state spins and
the appearance of shell closures in direct analogy to the atomic case).
Unfortunately, the assumption of independent nucleon motion that defines the model
also kneecaps its usefulness: in reality, nuclear systems are strongly
correlated and exhibit clustering and collective motion, behaviors at odds with the
the IPM picture.

-> can largely follow Bob and Wim's review paper
- first formulated in 1949 to describe neutron cross section data
- separate proton and neutron global optical potentials in the 60s (Becchetti
and Greenlees)
- CH89 includes additional neutron scattering data on isotopic targets

Takeaway: neutron scattering data particularly valuable for constraining these
models, but particularly challenging to access experimentally.

optical potential are poorly constrained by experiment." \cite{Holt16}

\section{Overview of Relevant Experimental Nuclear Data}
\subsection{Elastic nucleon scattering}
\subsection{Inelastic nucleon scattering}

New neutron scattering data (both \tot and \el) on isotopic targets, grist for the DOM mill and the 
central result of this dissertation, are presented in Chapters \ref{TCSAnalysis, ECSAnalysis}.

Neutron scattering is a direct, Coulomb-insensitive tool for probing the nuclear
environment. The simplest measurement of neutron interaction with a nucleus,
the neutron total cross section \tot, provides fundamental information about
nuclear size and the ratio of elastic-to-inelastic components of nucleon 
scattering. Additionally, \tot\ data are sensitive to a variey of nuclear
properties of great interest including the neutron skin of neutron-rich nuclei
\cite{Mahzoon2017} and thus the density dependence of the symmetry energy $L$,
essential for an accurate neutron star equation-of-state (EOS)
\cite{Fattoyev2012, Vinas2014, Brown2000}.

The earliest model for neutron scattering (a ``strongly-absorbing sphere"
picture) describes the nucleus as a constant-density sphere that interacts
strongly with incident neutrons approaching within a nuclear radius
\cite{Feshbach1949}. In this picture devoid of nuclear structure, \tot\ depends
only on size scaling of the interacting bodies:
\begin{equation} \label{SASAbsolute}
    \sigma_{tot}(E) = 2\pi(R + \lambdabar)^{2}
\end{equation}
where $R=r_{0}A^{\frac{1}{3}}$ and $\lambdabar$ is the reduced wavelength
of the incident neutron in the center of mass \cite{Fernbach1949, Satchler1980}. 
To compare \tot\ for two different targets of masses A and A', the relative
difference \totRD\ is useful:
\begin{equation} \label{SASRelDiff}
    \begin{split}
        \totRD & \equiv
    \frac{\sigma_{A}-\sigma_{A'}}{\sigma_{A}+\sigma_{A'}} \\
    & =
    \frac{r_{0}^{2}(A^{\frac{2}{3}}-A'^{\frac{2}{3}}) +
    2\lambdabar r_{0}(A^{\frac{1}{3}}-A'^{\frac{1}{3}})}
    {r_{0}^{2}(A^{\frac{2}{3}}+A'^{\frac{2}{3}}) +
    2\lambdabar r_{0}(A^{\frac{1}{3}}+A'^{\frac{1}{3}}) + 2\lambdabar^{2}}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
While on \textit{average}, experimental data comport with this naive
model, the key feature of \tot\ data is the obvious oscillatory
behavior centered about the average (visible in Fig.
\ref{SASphereVsExperiment}).

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/SASphereVsExperiment.png}
    \caption{Experimental neutron \tot\ data and strongly-absorbing-sphere predictions}
    \label{SASphereVsExperiment}
\end{figure*}

Experimental \tot\ data are shown from 2-500
MeV for nuclides from A=12 to A=208
\cite{Finlay1993, Schwartz1974, Poenitz1983, Abfalterer2000, Abfalterer2001}.
Predictions for \tot\ given by the ``strongly-absorbing sphere" (SAS)
model, Eq. \ref{SASAbsolute}, are shown as thin dashed lines for each nucleus.
Regular oscillations about the SAS model are clearly visible
as is the trend for the oscillation
maxima/minima to shift to \textit{higher} energies as A is increased. At low energies 
resonance structures are visible especially for light nuclides where the
density of states is smallest. Note that at higher energies, the experimental
cross sections drop below those predicted by the SAS model, illustrating
the failure of the SAS model to describe [surface physics accounted for in
optical models?].

These oscillations can be explained as the result of a phase shift between 
neutron waves passing around the nucleus (unshifted) and waves passing
through the the nucleus, where they experience refraction
(illustrated in Fig. \ref{RamsauerPhaseShiftFigure}). This explanation was termed the ``nuclear 
Ramsauer effect" by Peterson \cite{Peterson1962}, based on the analagous effect seen in 
electron scattering on noble gases.
In this picture, the intractable many-body
problem of the target nucleus is replaced by a smooth potential (hence the
``optical model" of the nucleus, \cite{Feshbach1958}) from which the refractive
index is easily calculated. As in the optical case, a complex index of
refraction can be used to neatly incorporate both elastic scattering (the real
potential) and all other scattering removing flux from the elastic channel (the imaginary potential).

\end{figure}

 A neutron wave train (series of
            blue lines) impinges from the left on a real Woods-Saxon
            potential centered at the origin (diffuse red circle). The potential
            refracts the neutron wave,
            retarding the phase of the wavefront as it passes through the
            potential. After escaping the potential, a phase difference $\Delta$ between
            the wave component passing \textit{around} and \textit{through the center}
            of the potential persists, resulting in scattering.
            For the leading wavefront in the wave train, $\Delta$ is indicated in
            the top right-hand corner of each panel. A differential version of
            Eq. \ref{phaseShift} is used to
            calculate the phase shift for each step. In this figure, the neutron
            energy $E_{n}$ = 14 MeV and nuclear mass $A$ = 25. For the Woods-Saxon potential,
            we used a potential depth $U$ = 42.8 MeV (following Angeli's analysis
            of \tot\ data at 14 MeV \cite{Angeli1970}), with nuclear radius $R = 
            r_{0}A^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $r_{0}$ = 1.4 fm, and a diffuseness parameter
        $a$ of 0.5 fm.
Following Angeli \cite{Angeli1970}, these considerations can be incorporated by
imbuing the strongly-absorbing sphere relations (equation \ref{SASAbsolute}) with an additional sinusoidal term:
\begin{equation} \label{OscillatoryModel}
    \tot = 2\pi (R+\lambdabar)[1 - \rho \cos(\delta)]
\end{equation}
where $\rho = e^{-\operatorname{Im}(\Delta)}$, and $\delta =
\operatorname{Re}(\Delta)$, with $\Delta$ the phase difference between the wave traveling
around and traveling through the nucleus. Thus, the amplitude of the oscillations provides the 
inelastic phase shift and the period of oscillation provides the elastic phase shift.
As can be seen from Eq. 
\ref{OscillatoryModel}, the large magnitude of the oscillations means that inelastic
scattering (from $\operatorname{Im}(\Delta)$) accounts for only a small fraction of the total cross section, in turn implying a 
much larger mean free path for neutrons through the nucleus 
than might otherwise be expected in the absence of Pauli blocking.
\cite{Mohr1955}.

If we approximate the nucleus with a
spherical potential of radius $R$ and depth $U$, the total phase shift $\delta$ is:
\begin{equation} \label{phaseShift}
    \delta =
    \frac{\overline{C}\left(\left[{\frac{E+U}{E}}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}-1\right)}{\lambdabar}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{C} = \frac{4}{3}R$ is the average chord length through the
sphere \cite{Angeli1970}. Rearranging Eq. \ref{phaseShift} in terms of A and E and
discarding leading constants yields:
\begin{equation}
    \delta \propto A^{\frac{1}{3}}\times\left(\sqrt{E+U}-\sqrt{E}\right)
\end{equation}
This form reveals an important relation: as A is increased, to maintain constant 
phase $\delta$, E must also increase \cite{Satchler1980, Peterson1962}. 
This is contrary to a typical resonance condition where an integer number of wavelengths
are fit inside a potential; in that case, to maintain constant phase as A is increased,
E must be decreased. Thus these \tot\ oscillations have been referred to as
``anti-resonances" or ``echoes" \cite{Satchler1980, McVoy1967}.

By including additional surface, spin-orbit, and other terms, optical models (OMs) have been 
used to successfully reproduce the general features of all manner of single-nucleon scattering 
data across the chart of nuclides up to several hundred MeV \cite{CH89}. 
However, despite the excellent agreement with experiment, optical models
involve the interaction of many partial waves with many sometimes-opaque terms
in the potential, complicating intuitive understanding of the underlying
physics at work.

By scattering secondary radioactive beams off of hydrogen targets in inverse
kinematics, proton-scattering experiments are possible even on highly unstable
nuclides. In contrast, because neutrons themselves must be generated as a
secondary radioactive beam, neutron-scattering experiments are restricted to
normal kinematics and \tot\ measurements are possible only for relatively stable
nuclides that can be formed into a target. At present, \tot\ measurements above
the resonance region on nuclides with short half-lives (shorter than the timescale of
days) are technically infeasible for this reason, though a handful have been carried out on
samples with half-lives in the tens to thousands of years \cite{Poenitz1983,
Phillips1980, Foster1971}.

Traditionally, \tot\ measurements have relied on analog techniques for recording
events, techniques that suffer from a large per-event deadtime of
up to several $\upmu$s. Thus for a typical intermediate-energy \tot\ measurement
with dozens or hundreds of energy bins, achieving statistical uncertainty at the
level of 1\% requires a thick sample to attenuate a sizable fraction of the
incident neutron flux. For cross sections in the 1-10 barn range, this means
sample masses of tens of grams \cite{Finlay1993, Abfalterer2001}.
Producing an isotopically-enriched sample of this size is often
prohibitively expensive; indeed, a literature search for isotopically-resolved
\tot\ measurements reveals a paucity of data from 1-300 MeV, even for
closed-shell isotopes of special importance like $^{3,4}$He, $^{64}$Ni, and
$^{204}$Pb (see Table \ref{IsotopicCrossSectionTable}).

With the need for improved neutron scattering data established and an overview of neutron
detection technology provided, the results of our neutron scattering measurement campaign can be
presented. The experimental layout and analysis for our isotopically-resolved \tot\ measurements are 
detailed
in Chapters \ref{TCSExperiment} and \ref{TCSAnalysis}, and for our elastic scattering measurements 
on \snTwelveFour in Chapters \ref{ECSExperiment} and \ref{ECSAnalysis}. A brief summary of the 
Dispersive Optical Model formalism is
given in Chapter \ref{DOMFormalism} in preparation for the results from our DOM fits of \oSixEight, \caAughtEight, 
\niEightFour, \snTwelveFour, and \pbEight presented in Chapter \ref{DOMResults}. Complete
details on the experimental data sets used in the analysis and figures showing the quality of the
fits are provided in Appendices \ref{DOMDataSets} and \ref{DOMFits}. 

At end of introduction:
- familiar with value of neutron scattering data for optical models and also as
fundamentally valuable for nuclear science; proton scattering data have been
accumulated, but neutron scattering data are much scarcer
- familiar with scarcity of certain types of difficult neutron and proton
scattering data (\tot, \rxnE)
- familiar with relevance to infinite nuclear matter equation of state and
neutron star radii

Questions posed:

- What do the nucleons do in the nucleus? Where are the neutrons and the protons
with respect to each other?

- What is needed to expand beyond current workhorse models (Droplet Model,
Shell Model, Optical Models) and connect nuclear reactions and structure

- What are the neutron scattering data for cornerstone nuclides (magic Z,N) and
what do they tell us about the isoscalar/isovector terms of the optical
potential and where the nucleons go/what they do in the nucleus?

- What types of experimental data are most essential for an improved understanding of nuclear
reactions and structure?
