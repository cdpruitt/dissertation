The Dispersive Optical Model (DOM) is a phenomenological framework useful for 
extracting information about nuclear properties and structure from experimental
data.

The fundamental object of interest in the DOM is the \Gls{optical potential},
which is identified as the \Gls{nucleon self-energy}. This potential represents
the nuclear environment experienced
by a nucleon as it traverses the nucleus being represented. In general, the
potential is both non-local and complex, possessing both real (flux-conserving)
and imaginary (flux-removing) parts. The functions used to parameterize the optical potential
are selected to conform with general physical intuition about the nuclear
many-body problem and past experience with optical potentials throughout the
field. For example, the most important term, the Hartree-Fock (HF) potential
that binds the nucleus together, is defined by a classic Woods-Saxon form to
which non-locality has been added: [insert volume term formula]. The imaginary
potential is separated into a Woods-Saxon volume component and a
Woods-Saxon-derivative surface component. Each of these subcomponents has
a non-linear energy dependence reflecting our expectation that surface-like
behaviors should arise around 10-20 MeV and volume-like behavior should dominate
above 50 MeV, with a mixture of the two in the intermediate region.

Beyond these basic considerations, several additional features make the 
DOM a useful tool. First is the enforcement of a
dispersion relation (the Kramers-Kronig relations) between the real and imaginary
halves of the potential, ensuring that the potential is causal (i.e., the
time-ordering of the operator representation of the self-energy is maintained).

DOM Parameterization

To parameterize the DOM's optical potential, we rely on standard functional
forms common in nuclear theory calculations.

The real part of the potential is comprised of a Hartree-Fock component and
a spin-orbit component (plus a Coulomb term if the projectile is a proton).
The Hartree-Fock component $V_{HF}$ has two subcomponents:

\begin{equation}
    V_{HF}(r,r') = V_{vol}(r,r') + V_{WB}(r)
\end{equation}

The non-local Hartree-Fock volume term $V_{vol}(r,r')$, is defined as
a Woods-Saxon form coupled to a Gaussian non-locality:

\begin{equation}
    V_{vol}(r,r') =
    \dfrac{-V}{1+e^{(r-R)/a}}\cdot\dfrac{1}{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}\beta^{3}}
    \exp{\frac{|r-r'|^{2}}{\beta^{2}}}
\end{equation}

where $V$, $R$, and $a$ are the depth, radius, and diffuseness of the HF potential,
and $beta$ is the extent of the non-locality. The local Hartree-Fock wine-bottle
term $V_{wb}(r)$, named for resemblence to the dimple at the bottom of a wine
bottle, is defined as a Gaussian centered at the nuclear origin:

\begin{equation}
    V_{wb}(r) = V\exp{\frac{r^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}}
\end{equation}

The real spin-orbit component $V_{so}$
is defined using a derivative-Woods-Saxon shape to
accommodate the expectation that the spin-orbit coupling is strongest near the
nuclear surface:

\begin{equation}
    V_{so}(r,r') =
    \frac{d}{dr}\left\dfrac{-V}{1+e^{(r-R)/a}}\right\cdot\dfrac{1}{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}\beta^{3}}
\exp{\frac{|r-r'|^{2}}{\beta^{2}}}
\end{equation}

The imaginary part of the potential is comprised of independent surface and volume terms
both above and below the Fermi surface, plus an imaginary spin-orbit term:

\begin{equation}
    V_{HF}(r,r') = V_{vol}(r,r') + V_{WB}(r)
\end{equation}
