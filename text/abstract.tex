Neutron scattering experiments provide direct access to the forces experienced by nucleons in the
nuclear environment. Due to the experimental difficulty of cross section measurements on neutrons compared to charged particles,
isotopically-resolved neutron scattering cross sections are sorely needed as inputs for many nuclear models.
This dissertation details the results from a campaign of
isotope-specific neutron total cross section measurements on \oSixEight, \niEightFour, \snTwelveFour, and \rhThree\ from
3-400 MeV, and elastic scattering differential cross section measurements on \snTwelveFour at 11 and 17 MeV. Equipped with these new data and
with computational improvements to the Dispersive Optical Model (DOM),
we present DOM treatments of \oSixEight, \caAughtEight, \niEightFour, 
\snTwelveFour, and \pbEight. From these analyses across the nuclear chart, we place additional 
constraints on the asymmetry-dependence of nuclear properties, extract essential bound-state 
quantities including spectroscopic factors and neutron skins, and identify experimental data types
most useful for further enhancing our understanding of nuclear structure.
