As with any high-dimensional optimization problem, the fitter must be vigilant
against the overfitting of data. In practice, this requires:

parsimony with the number of parameters used in the model

common-sense checking "under the hood" of the optimization to verify that
parameter values make sense given the assumptions that undergird the model

understanding of what the value function is (that is, the function being
minimized/maximized) and whether it needs to be changed

cross-correlation between parameters to understand the relationship between
parameters and the effect that each has on predictions made using the model
